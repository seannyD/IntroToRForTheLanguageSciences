 I've got stuck on this one though:
	ask: make a list of booleans where the items are TRUE if each corresponding item of nums is either 5 or 1.
	I've got nums == 1  which creates a boolean for 1 ok but can't figure out how to add the 5 in.
	I've tried nums == (1, 5) and nums == [1,5] and nums == 1,5 and nums == 1:5
	
	
Include task at end of part 4.


Do I introduce the 'names' function anywhere?
