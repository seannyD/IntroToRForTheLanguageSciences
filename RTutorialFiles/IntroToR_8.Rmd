If you've followed the previous tutorials, you should be able to complete the task below.  It might be a bit challenging, but try to tackle one part of the task at a time, and make sure your results are the expected ones.

**Task**:  The function `points` also has a `col` argument, where you can give it a vector which contains the colour for each point.  Make a map of the world with locations of languages, where the points are coloured by adposition type (variable **ObjectVerbOrder** in the file `data/WALS_ObjectVerbOrder.csv`).  The map **should not** contain languages which have no dominant order.

Write a script for this - don't try and do it directly in the console.

You'll need to:

* Load the WALS data
* Filter out languages where **ObjectVerbOrder** is `No dominant order`
* Draw a map
* Make a vector of possible adposition types.  The function `unique` will be useful here (if you don't know what it does, look up the help page).
* Make a vector of possible colours.  Either a numeric vector of 1, 2, 3, ... up to the number of colours, or you can use the function `rainbow`.
* Make a vector of colours, one for each language in d2, where the colour corresponds to the adposition order.  Remember, you can do this by:
    * indexing by name
    * using `match`
* Use the latter vector as the `col` arugment in `points`.

Here's my plot, with a legend for reference.  Click on the `code` button to the right to reveal one possible answer.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
setwd("~/Documents/Teaching/CARDIFF/RCourse/IntroToR/analysis/")

library(maps)

# state what file and variable I'm using
filename <- "../data/WALS_ObjectVerbOrder.csv"

#Load data
d = read.csv(filename, stringsAsFactors = F)

# Remove NAs
# We can use d[,variableName] to get the object verb order
d = d[!is.na(d$ObjectVerbOrder),]

# Remove 'no dominant order'
d = d[d$ObjectVerbOrder != "No dominant order",]
orderTypes = unique(d$ObjectVerbOrder)
colours = rainbow(length(orderTypes))
names(colours) <-orderTypes

# draw a map
map()
# add points
points(d$longitude, d$latitude, col= colours[d$ObjectVerbOrder])
# add a legend
legend(-45,-40, legend=orderTypes, col=colours, pch=16, ncol=2)
```
